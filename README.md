Hello, my name is Duncan, I'm a lecturer (≈ [Assistant Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor)) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. 

I'm currently writing an undergraduate course & textbook called *Coding Your Future* at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me/) to help students design, build, test and code their future in computing. I welcome any: 

* comments
* questions
* github stars
