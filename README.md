Hello, my name is Duncan, I'm a lecturer (≈ [Assistant Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor)) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. 

I'm currently writing an undergraduate textbook called *Coding Your Future* at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me/) - pull requests welcome! 👨‍💻

There's more info on me at [www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/)
